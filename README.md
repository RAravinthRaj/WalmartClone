# Walmart Clone

This project is a simplified clone of the Walmart website, focusing on the homepage, login page, and cart page.

It is built using React with Vite for fast development and uses TypeScript for type safety. Styling is handled with Styled Components to keep styles modular and scoped to components.

The layout is fully responsive and adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. The codebase follows a modular structure, making it easy to maintain and extend.

This project is intended for learning purposes and is not affiliated with Walmart.
